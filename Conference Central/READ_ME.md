# Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Project 4
# Course: Developing Scalable Apps in Python

### Description:

The objective of this project is to build upon backend functionality in the course-provided Conference Central Application.

###APIs:
* Google Cloud Endpoints
* Google API Explorer,

### 1: Add Sessions to a Conference

Endpoints added:
* createSession: open for organizer of conference 
* getConferenceSessions: return all sessions, knowing conference 
* getConferenceSessionsByType: Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type
* getSessionsBySpeaker: Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker for all conferences 


Endpoints and Classes were added to support multiple sessions per conference.
Sessions are memcached for performance because they can be queried often.


### 2: Add sessions ot User Wishlist

Wishlist are stored in the user's profile. Changes made to profile. 

Endpoints added: 
* addSessionToWishlist: adds the session to the user's list of sessions they will attend 
* getSessionsInWishlist: query for all the sessions in a conference that the user will attend 

### 3: Work on indexes and queries

Create 2 additional queries (see end of conference.py script)
* getThirtyMinSessions: find sessions that last between 0 and 30 minutes
* getGenericTypeSessions: return sessions of Generic Type

API Explorer enables the review of these queries

Query Problem: Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm?

The challenge is that an inequality filter can be applied to one attribute at a time. Since there are two attributes involved, workshops/non-workshops and start time before 7pm, two filters are required. One way to solve this is to assemble the types that are not workshop. Then implement a time filter. Finally, query the sessions including the filter information in the query. 
```py
type = ['NOT_SPECIFIED', 'KEYNOTE', 'LECTURE']
time = datetime.strptime("19:00", "%H:%M").time()

sessions = Session.query(ndb.AND(Session.typeOfSession.IN(type), Session.startTime < time))

return sessions
```

### 4: Add support for a feature speaker and an endpoint to get that speaker

* getFeaturedSpeaker(): When a new session is added to a conference if there is more than one session
   by this speaker, return featured speaker / sessions from memcache.

### Setup Instructions:

Note: To deploy this API server locally the [Google App Engine SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) is required.

1. Clone the git repository (or download it from the submission)
2. Run `dev_appserver.py DIR` or launch the app from the GUI app launcher Google provides in their API download.  Ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address, which is likely to be [localhost:8080][1]].

Instructions speicific to each deployment: 

1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.

2. Update the values at the top of `settings.py` to the CLIENT_ID you registered in the Google Developer Console

3. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID in your Google Developer Console 

4. (Optional) Mark the configuration files as unchanged as follows:
   `$ git update-index --assume-unchanged app.yaml settings.py static/js/app.js`

5. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default localhost:8080)

6. (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) [the endpoints tool][2].

7. Deploy your application.
